## 📌 About Me

I am a Robotics Instructor and Technology Enthusiast passionate about teaching students the fundamentals of robotics, electronics, and programming. This GitHub repository is a curated collection of my teaching materials, student projects, practice codes, and real-world demonstrations used in schools and training programs.

My goal is to make learning simple, practical, and hands-on, helping students understand concepts through projects rather than theory alone.
**This repository contains:**
* 🤖 Robotics project codes
* 🔌 Arduino-based experiments
* 📘 Student learning examples
* 🏫 School & academic projects
* 🛠️ Practice programs for beginners
* 📑 Reference materials for teaching
